<h2>SQL</h2>
<p>There are a couple ways to connect to a database instance. These examples show how to connect to a local PostgreSQL instance, and how to use the connection information to query a database.</p>
<div id="option-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Option 1</h3>
<p>Create connection chunk, then call connection in each subsequent chunk.</p>
<pre class="r fold-show"><code>library(DBI)

pass &lt;- readLines(&quot;../../pwd.txt&quot;)

db = dbConnect(
  RPostgres::Postgres(),
  dbname   = &quot;personal&quot;,
  host     = &quot;localhost&quot;,
  port     = 5432,
  user     = &quot;cgrant&quot;,
  password = pass
)</code></pre>
<pre class="sql"><code>select * from sleepdata</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="option-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Option 2</h3>
<p>Set default connection in the setup chunk (pretend its the setup chunk).</p>
<pre class="r fold-show"><code>library(DBI)
db = dbConnect(
  RPostgres::Postgres(),
  dbname   = &quot;personal&quot;,

  user     = &quot;cgrant&quot;,
