### Wet
> Wet weight (or as-is) basis means no calculation has been made to compensate for the moisture content of a sample

### Dry
> Dry weight basis means the lab has measured moisture content of a sample and calculated concentrations based on the percent solids present.


### Wet to Dry
$$DryWt = \frac{WetWt}{Percent Solids} * 100$$

### Dry to Wet
$$WetWt = \frac{DryWt * PercentSolids}{100}$$
<center>**DryWt & WetWt** = concentration<br>
**PercentSolids** = percentage (no decimal)</center>
